## Challenges Overcame:

# Learning Gamemaker in the time alloted in general was quite a challenge, but I watched all of the Gamemaker RPG tutorial videos (and others by the same creator) to learn the language better.
# Also, I was having issues with changing rooms working properly as they were all redirecting to the same room. That's when I realized that I had done something incorrectly on the players collide event.
# What I did incorrectly basically hardcoded so it would always redirect to the same room, so I fixed it to properly go by the data of the instance collided with.
# Also, making a ton of assets in a short amount of time was difficult. In case it isn't obvious, I have no musical experience so I made a really short melody. 
# Pixel art is a skill entirely different from the digital illustration I'm used to, this has definitely inspired me to improve my skills in that area too.
