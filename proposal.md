# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

# Stageplay Demo

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

# A deep cut of an full=length RPG game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

# It will be made on Gamemaker Studio and have a similar gameplay style to Earthbound. I can make the art and assets on my own.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

# A functional overworld area with at least one fight.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# One town with NPCs multiple battles, functional inventory.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# An entire section of the game with engaging story, a boss battle, and multiple party members.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

# I need to look at more tutorials on Gamemaker Studio and I need to work on creating sprites for the game. I'll need to look into how Gamemaker functions, how to make an inventory system, how to build a battle UI, and if I have enough time... how to make music. Also, how to make a character even move on the screen.
