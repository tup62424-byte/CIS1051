# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

# I want to do game design, probably with Gamemaker.
# The idea I have for it would be an RPG-style game - inspired by Earthbound/Octopath Traveler. (Probably moreso Earthbound for gameplay and Octopath for art direction. But that is a very big undertaking)
# Also, I'm an artist so it'd be fun to make my own assets for the game too.
# Lastly, the game would be in the style of acts, and it is a plot I already have thought out. So, I would probably only do a demo-length version of the game to try it out. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

# No collaborators.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

# Would you recommend a program other than Gamemaker? I know there's RPGmakers but they feel like they look more samey and have less customizability.
